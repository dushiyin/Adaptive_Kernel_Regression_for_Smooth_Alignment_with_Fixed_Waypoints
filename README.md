# Adaptive Kernel Regression for Smooth Alignment with Fixed Waypoints

This repository contains the source code for the arXiv preprint:

> **Adaptive Kernel Regression for Constrained Route Alignment:  
Theory and Iterative Data Sharpening**  
> arXiv:2501.01344

The repository implements the **ANW (adaptive Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression estimator)** and  
**DS-ANW (data–sharpened ANW)** methods proposed in the paper.

## Source Code Description

This repository contains the source code for the paper  
**"Energy-based segmentation methods for images with non-Gaussian noise"**.

The proposed framework is designed for image segmentation under non-Gaussian
noise conditions and provides adaptive switching between Gaussian and
non-Gaussian models.
