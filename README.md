## Source Code Description

This repository contains the source code for the paper  
**"Energy-based segmentation methods for images with non-Gaussian noise"**.

The proposed framework is designed for image segmentation under non-Gaussian
noise conditions and provides adaptive switching between Gaussian and
non-Gaussian models.
